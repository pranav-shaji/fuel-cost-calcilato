Fuel Consumption Calculator (Node.js Backend)
This is a simple backend application built with Node.js and Express.js to calculate fuel consumption based on the car's mileage (km per litre) and the distance traveled (in kilometers). The app takes user input for mileage and distance, processes the data, and returns the estimated fuel consumption in liters.
